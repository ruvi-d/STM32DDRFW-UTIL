Purpose
=======

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The STM32DDRFW-UTIL is the firmware
package for DDR configuration and test.</span>

This firmware contains a minimal set of drivers based on STM32CubeMP1xx and STM32CubeMP2xx Firmware packages:

-   HAL drivers
-   CMSIS Device
-   Cortex-A CMSIS Core
-   BSP for STM32MP1 and STM32MP2 Series MPUs
-   imageheader
-   resourcemanager (STM32MP2 only)

The DDR\_Tool directory includes STM32CubeIDE Projects for all ST
supported boards
